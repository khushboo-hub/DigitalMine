        		CSIR-CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF MINING AND FUEL RESEARCH (CIMFR)DHANBAD, a constituent laboratory under the aegis of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi aims to provide R&amp;D inputs for the entire coal-energy chain encompassing exploration, mining and utilization. The laboratory also strives to develop mineral based industries to reach the targeted production for country’s energy security and growth with high standards of safety, economy and cleaner environment.In view of the National Missions recently declared by the Government of India, CIMFR has re-aligned its vision, missions and policies and also redefined targets for shortand long terms. This would promote rapid sustainable national techno-economic growth withequal emphasis on self-sustenance. CSIR-CIMFR is located in the town of Dhanbad, known as coal capital of India of Jharkhand state of India. It is strategically situated in the Damodar basin of Eastern part of the country which is endowed with rich coal deposits and hosts several large mineral based industries.
