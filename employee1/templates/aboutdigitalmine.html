        		<p>
					A digital mine is the simulated version of physical mine. It is the simulation of
					mine-inclusivemachinery and equipment, aswell as simulation of the production process. It is considered to be a network ofmodels,methods, and tools supporting the entire operation of a production. Basic advantages of a digitalmine are continuous and consistent datamanagement, productionmanagement and consequent introduction of engineeringmethods and tools. A digitalmine provides information about different faces ofmines, roadways,minemechanics, electrical facilities, mine ventilation, safety, environmental condition, and so on. It helps increasing focus on miners’ safety and mine productivity. Digital solutions include creation of a “collaborative decision environment,” a facility that enables an integrated view of the mine plan and operations, leading to early identification and rectification of any bottlenecks across the value chain. Mine management seeks to add value by converting data into meaningful information and look to increase productivity by automating the actions required as a result ofmeaningful information. Digital mine technology helps to deploy collected information for estimating the failure probability of specific components rather than using a traditional time-based approach that reduces maintenance cost and prevents unplanned interruptions.
